In order to install rash:
1. Upload all .php and .html files to your webserver. You'll probably want to denote it to its own directory.
2. Run install.html inside the directory where you've uploaded the files through a web browser of your choice.
3. Read the instructions of what tables.php will do and how you need to edit config.php, and follow the link.
