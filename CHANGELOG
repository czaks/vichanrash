---From Rash 1.0:
12/06 - p00p
Changed admin login error message to "Login failed."
Replaced the calling of the template.php file with a variable, $templatefile, which is set in config.php.  This consisted of replacing the include to the template in the main file with one to the config file, adding a variable to the config file that specifies the template file, and removing the include to the config file that is in the template file.  I also removed every global variable in index.php.
Streamlined some structural elements of config.php.  Changed a few of the explanations to be more explanatory. :)
Moved $noservercnx, $nodbcnx, and $queryerror to index.php
Moved style variables from config.php to style.php, a part of the optional default template

Fixed Ben's mistake of erasing all the globals in each parent function (function such as home, browse, bla) by including config.php in each function. It was broken because there were no variables defined in the function, causing nothing to happen.

12/07 - p00p
Added a variable $rashversion to the top of index.php.
template.php now shows the version in the bottom bottomtdb.

12/07&&12/08 - tommah
Deleted a variable $bottomjimmy from style.php, and the css class relating to it.
Moved $title from config.php to template.php. It's template related.
Moved all error outputs to config.php, they would need to be globalized in all functions if they were to be used in index.php. Putting them in config.php does that automatically for us.
Added a declaration to style.php about hardcoded css classes.
Added a variable $loginfail to config.php. Error that you get for login failures, obviously, also put it in some places where login errors can occur, not quite sure I got them all.
Added a variable $sessionhandle to config.php. Error that you get for session used for ratingplus, ratingminus, and add quote.
Added a variable $rateplusyes to config.php to handle the confirm message for upping a rating on a quote.
Added a variable $rateminusyes to config.php to handle the confirm message for downing a rating on a quote.
Changed the color of $rashversion in template.php to a variable $versioncolor stored in style.php and called by a class setting with a span tag in template.php.
Added a variable $newslimit to config.php to set the limit of the number of news posts that the front page displays.

/*
Made a new section in config.php called Default Rash Template Customization.
Added a variable $welcomecolumn to section 3 of config.php to turn the left welcome column on or off. Best I could do was hardcode this :(.
Added a variable $welcomecolumncontent to section 3 of config.php to edit the content of the left column. Best I could do was hardcode this :(.
Added a variable $newscolumn to section 3 of config.php to edit the existance of the news column. Best I could do was hardcode this :(.

We need to come up with a way to get rid of all this shit.
*/
I renamed install.html and tables.php to install.what.html and install.what.php to mask them from the public. If tables is run, all our shit is erased.

Began extracting all HTML from index.php and puting in a file called output.php, this file will control the html outputs generated by the sql queries, include functions that will be called in each section function, and operate at what I hope will be smoothly.
Added $outputfile to config.php to declare what the output file is.
^^^^^^^ <-- working on it

12/13 - p00p
Added two variables:
$versionnumber contains the version number (1.0 in a 1.0-devel version)
$subversion is the devel in a 1.0 release
both those two and $rashversion in index.php must be edited for a new release

12/14 - p00p
Changed the legal message on all the php files it was in, and added it to 
a couple that it wasn't in.  (It should be in all of them now.)

12/15 - tommah
Made a templates folder. All template files should go there, since it's  just easier to manage.
Began changing <<ALL>> the ways quotes can be seen throughout index.php to rely on output.php to execute the code necessary to view them. This should lower filesize immensely.

12/23 - tommah
Moved adminpanel to respective templates rash_admin and bash_admin. (they're the same right now :-/)
Made the adminpanel nicer looking. (Both)
Made rash_template and bash_template their own respective folders in /templates.
Removed that $title variable from *_template.php.
Removed/renamed a lot of instances of stupid CSS classes in *_style.php and index/output.php so they make sense or are not redundant.
Set up all the $section variables so they can be called in templates with a switch in *_template.php.

12/28 - tommah
Added variable $flag_confirm to config.php
Added variable $cookie_time to config.php
Added variable $add_user_confirm to config.php
Added variable $not_loggedin_in to config.php
Added variable $add_news_confirm to config.php
Added variable $password_mismatch to config.php
Added variable $approve_quote_confirm to config.php
Added variable $quote_deleted to config.php
Added variable $deflag_confirm to config.php
Changed $sessionhandle to $cookie_already_set
Changed $quoteyes/no or whatever to $upgrade/downgrade_confirm
Made CREDITS file.
I changed every confirmation/error output, changed it into a variable, and put it in config.php so it can be changed easily by editing config.php.
Made all SQL queries in index.php awesome, relying on output from phpmyadmin for a template on query structure rather than my old makeshift ones.
Added new function qotw. Displays all quotes submitted within the last week.
Added new column to rash_quotes table in the mysql databse: date. It stores a unix timestamp to compare for the qotw function and could be called to show dates in quotes and such.
Split config.php into two more parts: part 3 Errors part 4 confirmation messages.
Got rid of $misuse from config.php, it wasn't used.

12/29 - tommah
Made a small bit of code to log out with. It's in the template and goes to ?logout in index.php.
*** Erased all tables and ran the installer script to see how it adapts. <-- it adapted perfectly by the way
Fixed that bug when inserting a quote/news that a single quote character would break the sql query. I finally got around to it. Hurray.
Upgraded rash_template to the extent bash_template was upgraded.
Deleted .mainpagebody CSS class from *_style.php, since it's not used.
Took out rash version junk in templates for release.

1/8 - p00p
Updated the version number to reflect the new development.
Fixed something silly I did before when I made the version variables 3 
	seperate vars.  Now $versionnumber represents the main version 
	(eg 1.0), $subversion represents the release (eg -devel)

---From Rash 1.1:
1/10 - tommah
Added [Edit] and [Delete] buttons after quotes if you're logged in so you can delete or edit the quote.
Fixed the search error where sortby did not work. (reason for release)

---From Rash 1.1.1:
1/15 - tommah
Fixed an error in templates calling to a nonexistant file.
Changed all the session login variables to cookies to fix header erorrs that have been occuring.

---From Rash 1.1.2:
2/08 - tommah
Fixed the header problems that made rash almost unusable
Tested rash on another server.

---From Rash 1.1.3:
2/15 - tommah
Fixed the bug that did not allow some users to change passwords
Fixed the bug that double processed htmlspecialchars(); resulting in code that was buggy and broken

---From Rash 1.2:
4/11 - tommah
Fixed bug that added extra slashes because addslashes() was run twice in added function. <-- removed addslashes()
Fixed same problem with adminadd()
Commented the above parts of all functions in index.php
Added an argument to login_check named $login_error, it's used to determine if a bad login message needs to be echo'd or not.
Fixed all the flawed code involving login_check. Previously, it made it so content() would not create, which would make an error of an undefined function when it got parsed through template() Putting the login_check inside content() fixes it. Also rid of the else statements that would return error login wrongs and just let the login_check function take care of it.
Removed qotw_format() and consolidated it's change into quote_format() using new argument $qotw_check()

4/12 - tommah
Added support to edit news posts
Changed global $sql; in aedit() and quote_edit() to function($sql). It's cleaner and easier to read, and just plain better.
Got rid of a lot of global (maybe all, not all at this moment) statments (global $var;) into function arguments ( function($var); ).
Added support for admins to delete news posts.
Made a function to connect to databases and process the sql query. Replaced all that connection code with this function.
Pretty much rewrote adminlogin(). It works now. If you put an invalid username, it gives $loginfail, same with password.
Updated all of rash_*.php files to valid XHTML. bash_*.php will remain HTML 4.01.
Got rid of rash_style.php in favor of rash_style.css. It's a *LOT* nicer now, I know :)

4/13 - tommah
Did a lot of template work based on what Tiddles told me.
Also did a url/other stuff seperator generation code or something, yet another Tiddles tweak

4/18 - tommah
Finally finished the css layout for Rash template. Yes, it took 5 days.
Split output.php into its own template-based output.php's (as of now, rash_output.php and bash_output.php) it adds better customization, and a better way to shift between styles.

---From Rash 1.2.1
5/27 - tommah
Made rash_template more cross-browser friendly by changing the news junk on the frontpage into a table rather than ghetto-rigged CSS and fixed anything else pertaining to that

6/8 - tommah
Finished rash_template (no i dont work on stuff constantly)
Fixed the qotw bug where it outputted everything

---Front Rash 1.2.2
6/11 - tommah
Added a meta tag to bash and rash templates to stop Google (and hopefully other spiders) from traversing down links and flagging/upgrading/downgrading all quotes.
